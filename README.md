# rock-paper-scissor

For this project I wanted to add a couple of features: a random hand generator, an input that would use Regex and a selection option. 
The way in was set up in version 1.0 included the random number but the code was looping over the count and was difficult to make it 
work properly. 

I restarted and learned that:
1 - It's ok to redo if the code is getting to complex. 
2 - First make it work, then make it better.
3 - Learned how to add sounds to events.
4 - How to create 2 branches for the same project in github.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the results. I tried to use objects to practice in my first version and used assets from it to complete
the final version.
